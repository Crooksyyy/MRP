In a similar manner to Ghitza and Gelman (2020) pretend you have access to a US voter file record from a private company. You train a model on the 2020 US Cooperative Election Study, and post-stratify it, on an individual basis, based on that voter file.

Put together a datasheet for the voter file dataset following Gebru et al. (2021)? As a reminder, datasheets accompany datasets and document “motivation, composition, collection process, recommended uses,” among other aspects.
Create a model card for your model, following Mitchell et al. (2019)? As a reminder, model cards are deliberately straight forward one- or two-page documents that report aspects such as: model details; intended use; metrics; training data; ethical considerations; as well as caveats and recommendations (Mitchell et al. 2019).
Discuss three ethical aspects around the features that you are using in your model? [Please write a paragraph or two for each point.]
Detail the tests that you would put in place in terms of the dataset, the model, and the predictions?
